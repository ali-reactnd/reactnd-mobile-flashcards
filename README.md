# Mobile Flashcards (UdaciCards)

* UdaciCards is a simple mobile application (_tested on Android_)
that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
* The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards
called **decks**, add flashcards (henceforth simply **card**) to those decks,
then take **quizzes** on those decks.
* Users are not able to delete or edit decks nor cards.
* The app reports quiz score but does not store it. Although, user will recieve a notification
at `8:00 p.m.` if they did not a quiz on that day.
